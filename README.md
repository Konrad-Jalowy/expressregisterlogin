# My Express login/register simple project
Very simple project to try out express and mongo.
Done. Well, i hope i find some validation library if im to stay in writing APIs in express...
Anyways, simple project, but with basic MVC, with basic error handling (catchAsync function is worth checking out).
Enjoy.
edit: already found validation library...
edit2: node/express journal: also found a library for rate-limiting, library for layouts in templating engine and some other libraries... i thought React (its not a framework) or jQuery are libraries. I also find it weird, that first you install a framework to a framework and then you must install a library for each and every single action... i thought Laravel is a lightweight framework... Thank God mongoose doesnt make me "npm install find-by-id package" or something like that... anyways i need to remember to implement those libraries in the next express project.
