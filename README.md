# My Express login/register simple project
Very simple project to try out express and mongo.
Done. Well, i hope i find some validation library if im to stay in writing APIs in express...
Anyways, simple project, but with basic MVC, with basic error handling (catchAsync function is worth checking out).
Enjoy.
